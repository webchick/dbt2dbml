# About dbt2dbml
This is a little script to parse a [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) model file like:

```
version: '2'
models:
- name: table_name
  description: Table description
  meta:
  columns:
  - name: column1
    description: Column 1 description
    tests:
    - not_null
    - unique
    - at_least_one
  - name: column2
    description: Column 2 description
...
  ```

...and turn it into a [DBML](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/) definition, like so:

```
Table {
  column1 x [note: "Column 1 description"]
  column2 x [note: "Column 2 description"]
]
```

# Ok... Why do I care?
Because THEN you can paste it into https://dbdiagram.io/ and get a lovely auto-generated E-R diagram like this! ðŸ¤©
